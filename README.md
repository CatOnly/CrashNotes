## Principle

1. <u>Articles need to be **maintained** as code</u>
2. <u>Keep the process of writing articles **Simple** and **Reliable**</u>
1. <u>Figure out the primary workflow</u>
   You do not have to fully mastered the technology when your work need it.
   Making an outline first and then filling in details.
2. <u>Work out a practical scheme</u>
